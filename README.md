# Picture Picker Application
## Users can render desired images with the help of Unsplash API by searching in the input field.
### Users can also utilize this app on a cross-site platform.
Handling Text Inputs
1) Create a new piece of State
2) Create an event handler to watch for the 'OnChange' event
3) Write the 'onChange' event fires, and get the value from the input.
4) Use the value from the input to update your state.
5) Pass your state to the input as the value prop.

When you update the state the component is going to be re-rendered.
->State update (not only updating the App component but also 
child );


Requirements for keys:-
1) Use whenever we have a list of elements.
2) Add the key to the top-most JSX element in the list
3) Must be a string or number
4) Should be unique for this list
5) Should be consistent across rerenders.
